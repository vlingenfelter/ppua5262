# Module 01

For this week's data assignment, briefly describe the structure of either your whole data set or of some meaningful subset (number of rows, columns, names of relevant variables).

 * Describe at least three cases (rows) from this set/subset using the information contained in the variables you see as relevant.
     - What have you learned from these cases individually, and from the differences between them?
     - How do they illustrate what we can learn from these data more generally?
     - Can you infer things about the cases that are not explicitly in the data?
