## Exploratory Data Assignment: Building Latent Constructs
Building off your work from last week, use the aggregate and sqldf commands to begin to build latent constructs that are based on aggregations of your data.

 - Be sure to describe why the construct is interesting and how the specific calculations you are using capture it.
 - As you analyze the content of these new variables, be sure to include at least one dot plot that shows the relationships between two variables at the aggregate level.
