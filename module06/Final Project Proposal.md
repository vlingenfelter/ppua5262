## Human Feces in San Francisco

For my final project I plan to analyze human waste on the streets of San Francisco. I will get data about where the waste is from 311 calls, which are made openly available by the city. I specifically want to look at the impact that a Department of Public Works program, the Pit Stop Program, has impacted the feces in the city, and if certain neighboorhood characteristics predispose an area to being shit on. I will do this by using the dataset provided by the city that shows locations of pit stops, as well as census data, and whatever other city data I can find that seems relevant (I am considering looking at slope of the city streets to see if that has some impact on where feces is occuring). 

Because the Pit Stops are only open during daylight hours (at latest 9 p.m.), I hope to do some sort of temporal analysis to look at when feces is occuring and if extending Pit Stop hours could help. This is limited, as the 311 calls represent not when the feces occurs, but when the feces is reported. I hope to be able to work around this in some meaningful way. 

My ultimate visual goal is to create a point map where the points are the poop emoji (ðŸ’©) representing calls. I plan on making a web map that has some sort of time slider functionality or a gif that shows change over time as well. I also plan to make a chloropleth map, with data aggregated either to the census block group level or the realator's neighborhood level, to show different liklihoods of feces occuring or relative shares. 

## But why look at poop?

I hope to figure out where points of intervention are in the city. I am also curious to see if the Pit Stop program is actually working. The Pit Stops are clustered around the Tenderloin and SoMa areas, with one in Hunter's Point. Should there be any pit stops on the other side of the city? Are there certain factors that predispose an area to getting more occurances of feces, and what can be done to intervene so that the poop goes in an appropriate receptacle? 

I expect to see that relative shares of calls relating to homelessness at large are increasing, while calls relating to feces are either decreasing or staying consistent.
