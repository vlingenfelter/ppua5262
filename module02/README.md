# Module 02
For this week's data assignment, briefly describe the structure of either your whole data set or of some meaningful subset (number of rows, columns, names of relevant variables).

 * Generate **at least three** interesting pieces of information or patterns from your data set and describe the insights they provide regarding the dynamics of the city. These can be communicated as numbers, graphs, or both and should convey what you see as the overarching information contained in the data set.

* Find **at least two** things in your data set that are strange or do not make sense.
