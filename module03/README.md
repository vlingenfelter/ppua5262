# Module 03

For this week's data assignment, briefly describe the structure of either your whole data set or of some meaningful subset (number of rows, columns, names of relevant variables).

 - Create **at least three** new variables, each of which must either;

    - make some angle of your dataâ€™s content more interpretable,

    - fix some issue in the data. Make sure to explain why these variables are useful.

 - Describe the contents of these variables using analysis and visualization.

**Remember:** You want this work to contribute to the construction of your Read-Me Document.

In addition, remember to include annotated code that shows the reader how you derived all of this information. This can be integrated into the write-up, as an appendix, or both. In either case be sure that the reader can connect specific lines of code to particular pieces of information.
