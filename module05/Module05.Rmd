## Latent Construct: Luxury

We want to look at how luxurious a given property is by developing a luxury metric. The ultimate goal with this metric is to look at if parcels are being taxed differently based on this luxury metric, i.e. more luxurious parcels pay higher taxes. 

### Ideas for Manifest Variables:
 - Number of rooms taking into account average square footage of room
 - Style of house related to when it was built
 - Yard size: how big is the difference between property size and building size?
 - Age of the home (this is tricky, there needs to be some implied idea about condition)
 - Nearness to ammenities like certain tax exempt parcels (like schools)
 - Distance to use codes like "industrial" use
 
### Things to sort out:
 - We will have to look at different building codes separately
