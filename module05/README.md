## Exploratory Data Assignment: Proposing New Measures

For this week's data assignment, propose at least one latent construct that you would like to measure with your data set and the geographic level at which you would want to measure it.

In addition, describe how this construct is interesting and at least one manifest variable for measuring it. Use the latent construct modeling notation from this week's lesson presentation to bring it across.

**Note**: Your manifest variable can be an idea at this point and we can figure out how to code it in R in the coming weeks. 

This is a graded assignment due by Sunday at 11:59PM via Turnitin. See course syllabus for specific guidelines and grading expectations.
